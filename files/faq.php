                                        Yes. We take the utmost care with the information that you provide us when placing an order on our website (or through any other means).  The server that hosts our bookstore encrypts the transmission of all credit card and personal customer information using the Internet-standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol.  During the encryption process, information is scrambled into small bits of code that cannot be read as they travel to us over the Internet. Once we receive the encrypted information, we use a private, one-of-a-kind key to decode it.
